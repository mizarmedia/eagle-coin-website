  {
    question: "Do you buy broken jewelry?",
    answer: "Yes, we buy gold and silver jewelry regardless of condition. Broken chains, single earrings, and damaged pieces are all welcome. We pay based on the precious metal content."
  },
  {
    question: "What forms of payment do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept cash, checks, and can arrange wire transfers for larger transactions. For purchases, we accept cash and most major payment methods."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an appointment?",
    answer: "No appointment is necessary during our regular business hours (Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri: 10am-5pm). However, for large collections or estate appraisals, we recommend calling ahead so we can dedicate proper time to evaluate your items."
  },
  {
    question: "How are prices determined?",
    answer: "All offers are transparent and based on current market prices. For bullion, we use live spot prices. For numismatic (collector) coins, we consider rarity, condition, and current market demand. We're confident we pay more than pawn shops for quality coins."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like your offer?",
    answer: "There's absolutely no obligation to sell. We provide free evaluations and you're welcome to take time to consider our offer or get a second opinion. We believe in building long-term relationships based on trust."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer house calls?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer house calls for your convenience, especially helpful for larger collections, estate situations, or if you're unable to visit our shop. Call 208-810-5351 to schedule."
